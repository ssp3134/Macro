**Consumer Spending and Business Cycles in the USA with a Focus on the COVID Pandemic**

The term paper focuses on studying the transmission of consumer spending to economic growth rates in the USA, with a specific emphasis on the impact of consumer spending during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project begins by acknowledging the profound and lasting impact of financial crises on economies, affecting various sectors and consumer behavior. The business cycle experiences fluctuations, and GDP is influenced significantly during such crises. The project identifies two major crises that affected the global economy, the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-21, and examines their effects on consumer spending and business cycles in the USA.

**Introduction:**
The introduction section provides an overview of the project, emphasizing the significance of studying past crises and their effects on the economy. It highlights the importance of consumer spending and its role in driving economic growth, accounting for a substantial portion of a country's total economic activity.

**Research Objective:**
The primary objective of the research paper is to study the relationship between consumer spending (Personal Consumption Expenditure - PCE) and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the USA from 2002 to 2023. It aims to analyze the impact of consumer spending on GDP and to examine the dependence of consumer spending on the country's GDP. The study also focuses on the effects of the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic on the US economy.

**Data Source:**
Data for the research is collected from the Federal Reserve of Economic Data (FRED) database. Quarter-wise GDP and PCE data from 2002 to 2023 are analyzed to understand the relationship between consumer spending and economic growth during normal and crisis periods.

**Stylized Facts:**
The section presents key observations derived from plotting and analyzing the data. It highlights the trends in GDP and PCE over the years, including periods of steady growth, significant recessions, and the impacts of the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis shows the fluctuations in GDP and PCE during these crisis periods and their subsequent rebounds.

**Data Analysis:**
The data analysis section includes various statistical techniques to explore the relationship between GDP and PCE. Correlation matrices are plotted to examine the correlation between GDP, PCE, and crisis periods. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is performed to check stationarity in the time series data. The autocorrelation analysis is conducted to understand the relationship between current and lagged values of the series.

**Regression Analysis:**
Regression analysis is employed to study the relationship between consumer spending and GDP, considering other variables such as the presence of a crisis. The analysis reveals a positive relationship between GDP and PCE and a negative impact of crises on consumer spending.

**Conclusion:**
The conclusion summarizes the findings of the research paper. It emphasizes the strong correlation between consumer spending (PCE) and economic growth (GDP) in the USA, underscoring the crucial role of consumer spending in driving the economy. The impact of the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer spending and business cycles is discussed, with a focus on the sharp decline and subsequent rebound in GDP and PCE during these periods.

**References:**
The project concludes with a list of references used to gather data and information for the research paper.

Overall, the term paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between consumer spending and economic growth in the USA, with valuable insights into the impact of significant crises on the country's economy. The study offers valuable information for policymakers, economists, and scholars interested in understanding the dynamics of consumer spending and its role in shaping the business cycles in the USA.
